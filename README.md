🧠 Perceptron Classification using Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Perceptron model, which is the foundation of Neural Networks and Deep Learning, using Python and scikit-learn.

It is intended for beginners who want to understand how machine learning models are trained and evaluated.

📌 Project Description

In this project:

A synthetic dataset is generated for binary classification

The dataset is split into training and testing sets

A Perceptron classifier is trained on the data

Model accuracy is evaluated on unseen test data

This helps in understanding supervised learning, linear classifiers, and model evaluation.
